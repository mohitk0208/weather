This is React Project to get the weather details of a location either through _device location_
or by searching through _cityname_.

This project is using [openweathermap api](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get all the weather data.

**The Weather Data includes:**

-current weather data.
-hourly weather report for next 48 hours.
-weather details for next 7 days.

All the information is nicely represented on a glassy look webpage with frosted & blury background to make the details clearlly visible.

The background changes dynamically according to the current weather.
