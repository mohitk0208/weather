This is React Project to get the weather details of a location either through device location
or by searching through cityname.

This project is using openweathermap api to get all the weather data.

The Weather Data includes:-

current weather data.
hourly weather report for next 48 hours.
weather details for next 7 days.

All the information is nicely represented on a glassy look webpage with frosted & blury background to make the details clearlly visible.

The background changes dynamically according to the current weather.
